This is a starter for a Kohana project. If you are not going to use the most recent 
version of Kohana, just pull down the application and assets directories rather 
than cloning the project. It has been tested to work with Kohana 3.1.4.

It has been recently updated to follow an HTML5 boilerplate standard, and an updated 
html helper class (which extends the original)  has been set up to facilitate the 
new standard.

By default it uses mootools as the core js engine.

*Note:* I would consider it a normal thing to need to edit the master class and 
skeleton view based on project needs, but the changes should be minimal.
